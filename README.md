# Amazon Custom Storefront

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). It provides a basic example of a storefront with custom styling connected to Amazon's product library. Shopping Cart data is currently stored in localStorage only but can easily be extended to be attached to Amazon customer account/shopping cart and/or local database.
